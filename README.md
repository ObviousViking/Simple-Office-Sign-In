# Simple-Office-Sign-In
A simple web app that allows visitors to an office to sign in and out.


This web app i ran using WAMP on a little touch screen Pc in the office. Anyone that didn't work in the office was required to sign in and out.

This made it a bit easier than a sheet of paper.

Visitors need to fill out the name and organisation, that then gets listed in the database and listed on screen as a current visitor.

When they leave they tap, sign out, then it auto fills the sign out time in the database.

Theres some nice little analytics for paper saved, busiest day etc.

The history can be viewed and download to CSV.



For WAMP, install it, then drop the OfficeCheckIn folder in the 'www' folder in the WAMP install location.  
You should then be able to get to it using 127.0.0.1/officesignin
